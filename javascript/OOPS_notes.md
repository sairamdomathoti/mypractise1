OOPS
      It is Approach and Resusability

C -> Functional / Structural based programming - top down approach
C++ -> Object Oriented Programming - Bottom up approach
Python -> Generic programmin (support both functional and oject oriented)
Javascript -> Pure Functional Based (ES6 & ES7 it supports object oriented)

Core Concepts -

1. Class - it is way to bind the properties as well as the methods
    - constructor - to initialise any values/variables, it is function
    - destructor -  to deinitialise any values/variables
2. Object - It is a Real time entity. it is used to call the methods, properties in the class.
3. Data Abstraction - it focus on the whatever we need
4. Data Encapsulation - data hiding.
5. Inheritance (parent - child relation) - Super is the keyword to use objects from parent function
6. Polymorphism - one thing many forms, example - water.

method - fucntion
property - variables (key:value)
